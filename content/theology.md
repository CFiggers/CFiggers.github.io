### What's Theology?

**Theology** is the spiritual and academic study of [[God]] and what he communicates to humanity (this is called [[Revelation]]).

* Θεός ("theos") = "God"
* λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Theo**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words of God." This way of phrasing it contains an intentional double meaning: "Words *of* God" can mean "words about God," as in what we have to say and understand *about God.* It can also mean "words *from* God," as in what God has to say and what we can therefore understand *about everything else.* 

I think of **Theology** as the starting place where all other understanding begins (but not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of **Theology** as a tree with branches. Different people group the branches of **Theology** differently (and that's ok--see the section at the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Theology** as having the following branches:

Of God:
* [[Theology Proper]] - The study of God himself.
* [[Christology]] - The study of [[Jesus Christ]]
* [[Pneumatology]] - The study of [[The Holy Spirit]]

Of God's other [[Revelation]]:
* [[Ktisiology]] - The study of what God reveals about [[Creation]]
* [[Hamartiology]] - The study of what God reveals about [[Sin]]
* [[Soteriology]] - The study of what God reveals about his plan for [[Redemption]]
* [[Ecclesiology]] - The study of what God reveals about his Church
* [[Eschatology]] - The study of what God reveals about the way the story ends

Of Application:
* [[Biblical Studies]] - The study of [[Revelation]] in [[The Bible]]
* [[Academic Theology]] - The study of Theology itself (this list is an example of Academic Theology!)
* [[Practical Theology]] - The study of using Theology in real life and in other fields of study (like [[Philosophy]])

### Are "Theology" and "Doctrine" different?

Yes. Many Doctrines (like [[Calvinism]] or [[Doctrine of the Trinity]]) are combinations of multiple positions within various branches of **Theology**.
