**"Existence Precedes Essence"** is an extremely concise summary of [[Existentialism]]'s core claim about [[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]. These three words were first coined by Existentialist [Philosopher](/philosophers)<!-- [[Philosophers]] --> [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], but the idea [was](/soren-kierkegaard)<!-- [[Soren Kierkegaard]] --> [around](/martin-heidegger)<!-- [[Martin Heidegger]] --> for a while before he phrased it so pointedly.
