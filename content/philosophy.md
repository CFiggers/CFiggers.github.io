### What's Philosophy?

The word "**Philosophy**" comes from [[Greek]]:

* φίλος ("philos") = "Love"
* σοφία ("sophia") = "Wisdom"

So "**Philo**" + "**sophy**" literally means "Love of Wisdom." I think of **Philosophy** as a sub-category of [[Practical Theology]] (but not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of **Philosophy** as a tree with branches. Different people group the branches of **Philosophy** together differently (and that's ok--see the section at the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Philosophy** as having the following six branches:

Input:
* [[Metaphilosophy]] - The study of Philosophy itself (this list is an example of Metaphilosophy!)
  
The Core:
* [[Metaphysics]] - The study of "reality"
* [[Epistemology]] - The study of "knowing"
* [[Axiology]] - The study of "goodness"
* [[Logic]] - The study of "reasoning"
  
Output:
* [[Applied Philosophy]] - The study of using Philosophy in real life and in other fields of study

### There's so many "-ism"s in Philosophy!

Many "-ism"s (like [[Rationalism]] or [[Marxism]]) are combinations of multiple positions within various branches of **Philosophy**. It's very common for [[Metaphysics]] and [[Epistemology]] to inter-relate, because *"What actually exists?"* and *"How do I know about it?"* are hard questions to separate.

Here's some examples:

* [[Existentialism]]
  * [[Metaphysics]]: [["Existence precedes essence."]]
  * [[Epistemology]]: Opposed to [[Positivism]] and [[Rationalism]]
* [[Nihilism]]
  * [[Metaphysics]]: Existence has no [[Meaning]] or [[Value]].
  * [[Epistemology]]: [[Knowledge]] is an illusion (at least, for human beings).
* [[Platonism]]
  * [[Metaphysics]]: Abstract concepts really exist, independent from material stuff.
  * [[Epistemology]]: [[Knowledge]] is the [[Virtue]] of recognizing [[The Good]].

### On Labels

At the end of the day, "label" words like "[[Existentialism]]" are **made up.** Lots of [[Philosophers]] reject labels, even some who sound an awful lot like other people who like that same label and happily apply it to themselves. 

This is ok! Philosophy words are sometimes helpful. Sometimes they're not. Like any words, Philosophy words are limited. Use them as helpful hints for your understanding more than absolute categories you can always be certain about.

Not everyone separates "Philosophy" into the same six branches I have above. That's ok. Not everyone would agree with my super-brief summaries of the "-ism"s in the previous section. That's also ok. Philosophy is trying to understand things better--it isn't an exact science (I would say the same about [[Science]], incidentally!). The categories will never be perfect--so if these ones help you, use them! If not, I'm ok with that too.
