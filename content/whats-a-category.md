title: What's a Category?
---

In [[Category Theory]], a **Category** is a collection of logical relationships. The weird thing is, only the relationships are important-the things *being related* actually don't matter. That's confusing at first, but it's part of what makes Category Theory useful for so many things.

Categories must follow [three laws](/category-theory-s-three-laws) to be a valid category (the third one is more of a convenience than a law).
