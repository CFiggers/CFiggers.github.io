### What's Category Theory?

**Category Theory** is an *extremely* abstract branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>. 

Most branches of math (like Arithmetic, Algebra, Calculus, etc.) use numbers and symbols to calculate things. **Category Theory** is about calculation itself.
